# Intelligent Study Assistant

## Overview
The Intelligent Study Assistant is an AI-powered application designed to help students efficiently retrieve and summarize information from various document types, including PDFs, Word documents, and EPUBs. By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the application allows users to ask questions and receive accurate answers based on the contents of their uploaded materials.

## Features
- **Document Upload**: Supports multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, EPUB).
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from documents and segments it into manageable sections.
- **AI-Powered Q&A**: Utilizes the Cohere API to generate relevant answers based on user queries.
- **Embeddings and Similarity Search**: Creates embeddings for text chunks and performs similarity searches to find relevant sections.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Cohere API
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- PyPDF2, python-docx, ebooklib, BeautifulSoup
- Sentence Transformers
